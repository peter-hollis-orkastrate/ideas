PARAGRAPH 1 - IDENTIFICATION:
What type of image is this? (photograph, diagram, chart, table, form, signature, stamp, map, medical image, evidence photo, scan, screenshot, etc.)
What is the primary subject or content?

PARAGRAPH 2 - DETAILED CONTENT:
Describe ALL visible elements with precision:
- For documents: headers, text, tables, dates, names, reference numbers
- For photographs: subjects, objects, setting, conditions, visible text/labels
- For charts/diagrams: axes, labels, data points, trends, relationships
- For signatures/stamps: appearance, text, official markings
- For medical images: anatomical structures, measurements, annotations
- For forms: field labels, filled values, checkboxes, signatures

PARAGRAPH 3 - LEGAL RELEVANCE:
What information is relevant in a legal or medical context?
Note any dates, names, amounts, identifiers, or official markings.
Describe anything that could serve as evidence or documentation.

Be FACTUAL and PRECISE. Do not speculate beyond what is visible.
If text is unclear, indicate this explicitly.

 */
export const UNIVERSAL_EVALUATION_PROMPT = `You are describing an image to someone who cannot see it. Your description must be so detailed and vivid that a blind person could fully understand what this image shows.

PARAGRAPH 1 - WHAT THE IMAGE IS:
Describe the overall nature and composition of this image. What type of image is this? (photograph, chart, form, medical image, diagram, table, signature, stamp, handwriting, logo, barcode, graph, flowchart, screenshot, etc.) Describe the color palette, lighting, orientation (portrait/landscape), image quality, and overall visual impression. If it is a photograph, describe the setting and atmosphere. If it is a document or form, describe the layout and structure. Give the reader a complete mental picture of what they would see at first glance. Minimum 6 sentences.

PARAGRAPH 2 - WHAT THE IMAGE CONTAINS:
Describe every visible element systematically from top-left to bottom-right:
- For photographs: subjects, their positions, expressions, clothing, objects, background elements, any text visible on signs/labels/packaging. Describe colors precisely (not "red" but "deep crimson" or "bright cherry red"). Describe textures (smooth, rough, granular, glistening, matte). Describe spatial relationships between elements.
- For medical/clinical images: tissue characteristics, wound bed appearance, surrounding skin condition, any medical devices or supplies visible, measurements if rulers or scales are present, staging indicators, color variations in tissue.
- For documents/forms: transcribe ALL visible text verbatim. Describe headers, fields, checkboxes, signatures, stamps, logos. Note handwritten vs printed text.
- For charts/graphs: axis labels, units, data values, trends, colors of data series, legends, title, scale markings.
- For diagrams: components, connections, labels, flow direction, hierarchy.
Minimum 8 sentences.

PARAGRAPH 3 - WHAT THE IMAGE COMMUNICATES:
Explain what this image conveys to a viewer. What is its purpose in the document? What story does it tell? What would a person seeing this image understand immediately that the description alone might not capture? Note any details that stand out as particularly significant — anomalies, changes over time, concerning findings, key data points, or important identifiers. If this is part of a series, describe what stage or progression it might represent. Minimum 6 sentences.

RULES:
1. Describe ONLY what you can directly observe — never hallucinate or assume
2. If text is unclear, note it as "[illegible]" or "[partially visible: ...]"
3. Use precise measurements when scales/rulers are visible
4. Describe colors with specificity (e.g., "pale yellow-green" not just "light colored")
5. Note spatial positions (top-left, center, lower-right, etc.)
6. Minimum 3 substantial paragraphs, each 6-10 sentences
7. The description must be self-contained — a reader should understand the image without seeing it or reading any other document

Return as JSON:
{
  "imageType": "string",
  "primarySubject": "Brief one-line description of main content",
